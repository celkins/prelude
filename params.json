However, the\r\nprocess of coming up with a useful Emacs configuration is long and\r\ndifficult. It's this process that separates you from truly taking\r\nadvantage of Emacs's power. I like to refer to this process as the\r\n**Prelude**. **Emacs Prelude** has the goal to ease the initial Emacs\r\nsetup process and to provide you with a much more powerful and\r\nproductive experience than the one you get out of the box. By using\r\n**Emacs Prelude** you're basically getting a *\"Get me out of the\r\nPrelude, I just want to use Emacs\"* card.\r\n\r\nEmacs Prelude is compatible **ONLY with GNU Emacs 24.x**. \r\n\r\n## Fast Forward\r\n\r\nAssuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,\r\netc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as `git` & `curl` you\r\ncan skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now power up your Emacs, sit back and enjoy Prelude,\r\nforgetting about the rest of this manual.\r\n\r\nThere are two environment variables you can use to control the \r\nsource repository and the installation directory. To change the \r\ninstallation directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ export PRELUDE_INSTALL_DIR=\"$HOME/.emacs.d\" && curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo change the source repository:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ export PRELUDE_URL=\"https://github.com/yourname/prelude.git\" && curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the installer will back up any existing `.emacs` file or\r\n`.emacs.d` since it will unpack Prelude's code in `.emacs.d`. If\r\nyou're doing a manual install make sure you don't have a `.emacs` file\r\nor back up your existing `.emacs.d` directory manually.\r\n\r\n## More goodies\r\n\r\nThe [Prelude Modules](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude-modules)\r\nproject contains a lot of additional packages for Prelude\r\n(install-able via the `package-list-packages` command) - enhanced programming\r\nmode configs, latex config, erc config, etc.\r\n\r\n## Installing Emacs 24\r\n\r\nObviously to use the Emacs Prelude you have to install Emacs 24\r\nfirst. Have a look at the [WikEmacs articles on installing Emacs](http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Installing_Emacs).\r\n \r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Automated\r\n\r\nYou can install **Emacs Prelude** via the command line with either `curl` or\r\n`wget`. Naturally `git` is also required.\r\n\r\n#### Via Curl\r\n\r\nIf you're using `curl` type the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Via Wget\r\n\r\nIf you're using `wget` type:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh -O - | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/bbatsov/prelude.git path/to/local/repo\r\n$ ln -s path/to/local/repo ~/.emacs.d\r\n$ cd ~/emacs.d\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd do well to replace `~/.emacs.d` with the value of\r\n`user-emacs-directory` for your OS. You can check the value by doing\r\n`C-h v user-emacs-directory` inside Emacs.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nNothing fancy here. Just start Emacs as usual. Personally I run Emacs\r\nin daemon mode:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ emacs --daemon\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards I connect to the server with either a terminal or a GUI\r\nclient like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ emacsclient -t\r\n$ emacsclient -c\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd probably do well to put a few aliases in your `.zshrc` (or\r\n`.bashrc`):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nalias e=emacsclient -t\r\nalias ec=emacsclient -c\r\nalias vim=emacsclient -t\r\nalias vi=emacsclient -t\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last two aliases are helpful if you're used to editing files from\r\nthe command line using `vi(m)`.\r\n\r\n## Getting to know Prelude\r\n\r\nCertainly the best way to understand how Prelude enhances the default\r\nEmacs experience is to peruse Prelude's source code (which is\r\nobviously written in Emacs Lisp). Understanding the code is not\r\nnecessary of course. Prelude includes a `prelude-mode` minor Emacs mode\r\nwhich collects some of the additional functionality added by\r\nPrelude. It also adds an additional keymap that binds many of those\r\nextensions to keybindings.\r\n\r\n### Keymap\r\n\r\n#### Global\r\n\r\n* `C-M-h` - `backward-kill-word` (as in Bash/Zsh)\r\n* `C-x \\` - `align-regexp`\r\n* `C-+` - `text-scale-increase`\r\n* `C--` - `text-scale-decrease`\r\n* `C-x O` - return you to the previous window (the inverse of `other-window` (`C-x o`))\r\n* `C-x ^` - `join-line`\r\n* `C-x p` - `proced` (manage processes form Emacs, works only in Linux)\r\n* `C-x m` - start eshell\r\n* `C-x M-m` - start your default shell\r\n* `C-x C-m` - sames as `M-x`\r\n* `C-h A` - `apropos` (search in all Emacs symbols)\r\n* `M-\\` - `hippie-expand` (a replacement for the default `dabbrev-expand`)\r\n* `C-x C-b` - `ibuffer` (a replacement for the default `buffer-list`)\r\n* `F12` - toggle the Emacs menu bar\r\n* `C-x g` - open Magit's status buffer\r\n* `C-=` - `expand-region` (incremental text selection)\r\n\r\n#### Prelude Mode\r\n\r\n* `C-c o` - open the currently visited file with external program\r\n* `C-c g` - search in Google for the thing under point (or an interactive query)\r\n* `shift+return` - insert an empty line and indent it properly (as in most IDEs)\r\n* `control+shift+up` - move the current line up\r\n* `control+shift+down` - move the current line down\r\n* `C-c n` - fix indentation in buffer and strip whitespace\r\n* `C-c f` - open recently visitted file\r\n* `C-M-\\` - indent region (if selected) or the entire buffer\r\n* `C-c u` - open URL in your default browser\r\n* `C-c e` - eval a bit of Emacs Lisp code and replace it with its result\r\n* `C-c s` - swap two active windows\r\n* `C-c d` - duplicate the current line (or region)\r\n* `C-c r` - rename the currently visited file and buffer\r\n* `C-c t` - open a terminal emulator (`ansi-term`)\r\n* `C-c k` - kill all open buffers except the one you're currently in\r\n* `C-c h` - open Helm (a useful means of navigating your buffers and project files)\r\n\r\n#### Projectile\r\n\r\nHere's a list of the interactive Emacs Lisp functions, provided by projectile:\r\n\r\n* `projectile-find-file` <kbd>C-c p f</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-grep` <kbd>C-c p g</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-switch-to-buffer` <kbd>C-c p b</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-multi-occur` <kbd>C-c p o</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-replace` <kbd>C-c p r</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-invalidate-cache` <kbd>C-c p i</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-regenerate-tags` <kbd>C-c p t</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-kill-buffers` <kbd>C-c p k</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-dired` <kbd>C-c p d</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-recentf` <kbd>C-c p e</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-ack` <kbd>C-c p a</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-compile-project` <kbd>C-c p l</kbd>\r\n* `projectile-test-project` <kbd>C-c p p</kbd>\r\n\r\n### Automatic package installation\r\n\r\nThe default Prelude installation comes with a bare minimum of\r\nfunctionality. It will however install add-ons for various programming\r\nlanguages and frameworks on demand. For instance - if you try to open\r\na `.clj` file `clojure-mode`, `nrepl.el` and prelude's enhanced Lisp\r\nconfiguration will be installed automatically for you.\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, install anything you wish manually as well.\r\n\r\n### Color Themes\r\n\r\nEmacs 24 ships with a new theming facility that effectively renders\r\nthe old color-theme package obsolete. Emacs 24 provides a dozen of\r\nbuilt-in themes you can use out-of-the-box by invoking the `M-x\r\nload-theme` command.\r\n\r\n[Zenburn](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) is the default color theme in Prelude, but you can change it\r\nat your discretion. Why Zenburn? I (and lots of hackers around the\r\nworld) find it pretty neat for some reason. Personally I find the\r\ndefault theme pretty tiresome for the eyes, that's why I took that\r\n\"controversial\" decision to replace it. You can, of course, easily go\r\nback to the default (or select another theme entirely).\r\n\r\nTo disable Zenburn just put in your personal config the following\r\nline:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(disable-theme 'zenburn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can use another theme altogether by adding something like:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)\r\n```\r\n\r\nP.S. Solarized is not available by default - you'll have to install it from MELPA first.\r\n\r\n### Personalizing\r\n\r\nFork the official Prelude repo and add your own touch to it. You're advised to avoid changing stuff outside of the\r\npersonal folder to avoid having to deal with git merge conflicts in the future.\r\n\r\n#### Enabling whitespace-mode\r\n\r\nAlthough `whitespace-mode` is awesome some people find it too\r\nintrusive so it's disabled by default. You can enable it in your\r\npersonal config with the following bit of code:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(setq prelude-whitespace t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Disable flyspell-mode\r\n\r\nIf you're not fond of spellchecking on the fly:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(setq prelude-flyspell nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Caveats & Pitfalls\r\n\r\n### Problems with flyspell-mode\r\n\r\nPrelude makes heavy use of the flyspell-mode package for spell\r\nchecking of various things. The proper operation of flyspell depends\r\non the presence of the `aspell` program and an `en` dictionary on your\r\nsystem. You can install `aspell` and the dictionary on OS X with\r\n`homebrew` like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install aspell --lang=en\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Linux distros - just use your distro's package manager.\r\n\r\n### Ugly colors in the terminal Emacs version\r\n\r\nIf your Emacs looks considerably uglier in a terminal (compared to the\r\nGUI version) try adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ export TERM=xterm-256color\r\n```\r\n\r\nSource the `.bashrc` file and start Emacs again.\r\n\r\n### MELPA error on initial startup\r\n\r\nIf you get some http connection error related to the MELPA repo\r\njust do a manual `M-x package-refresh-contents` and restart Emacs\r\nafterwards. \r\n\r\n### No arrow navigation in editor buffers\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug - it's a feature! I firmly believe that the one true\r\nway to use Emacs is by using it the way it was intended to be used (as\r\nfar as navigation is concerned at least). That's why I've disabled all\r\nmovement commands with arrows (and keys like page up, page down, etc) - to prevent you from being tempted to\r\nuse them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd still like to use the arrow keys just invoke `M-x\r\nguru-mode` to enable them for the duration of your\r\ncurrent Emacs session or add the following snippet to your\r\npersonal Emacs customization to enable them permanently:\r\n\r\n```lisp\r\n(setq prelude-guru nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Windows compatibility\r\n\r\nWhile everything in Prelude should work fine in Windows, I test it only\r\nwith Linux & OSX, so there are Windows related problems from time to\r\ntime. This situation will probably improve over time.\r\n\r\n## Share the knowledge\r\n\r\n[WikEmacs](http://wikemacs.org) collects useful resources for working\r\nwith GNU Emacs.
